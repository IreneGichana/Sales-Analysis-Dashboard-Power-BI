# Power-BI-Project
# GirlLead Sales Dashboard
## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides an insightful analysis of sales performance, covering number of customers, total quantity sold, revenue generated, and insights.

## Data
The data contains 65,535 rows and 10 rows after merging.

The rows are as follows:

invoice_no - Invoice number

customer_id - The customer id

category - The type of product purchased

quantity - The quantity purchased

price - The price of the item

invoice_date - Date of purchase

shopping_mall - The shopping mall where the product was purchased

gender - The gender of the customer

age - The age of the customer

payment_method - The payment method used

## Data Preparation
- Merged two tables (Sales and Customer Data) to create a unified dataset for analysis.
- Handled missing data by labeling them as "Unknown" as they were important for insights generation.
- Grouped age data into categories (e.g., Under 25, 25-34, 35-54, 55+) for better demographic segmentation.
